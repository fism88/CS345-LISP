[ ] Add subract function
[ ] Add multiplication function
[ ] Add divide function
[ ] Add function to test if a list is empty
[ ] foldr preloaded like car/cdr/cons
[ ] combinators preloaded like car/cdr/cons
[ ] Add error handling for:
    syntax errors
    type mismatches
    wrong number of arguments to a function
[ ] Add flag to toggle between static or dynamic scoping.
    It'd be nice if this was a command line argument
    Like: "java Parser -d" or "java Parser --dynamic" for dynamic scoping.
[ ] It'd also be nice if we had flags for toggling between different kinds
    of output. Like...maybe a TRACE flag to show each step of execution,
    and maybe a DEBUG flag for more verbose output.
[ ] It'd be nice if we wrote debug output to a log file, since it's
    hard to view just printing to stdout.

[X] Add subract function
[X] Add multiplication function
[X] Add divide function
[ ] Add function to test if a list is empty
[wtf] list combinators
[ ] foldr with list combinators
[x] whole number combinators preloaded like car/cdr/cons
[ ] Add error handling for:
    syntax errors
    type mismatches
    wrong number of arguments to a function
[x] Cleanup output some more
    -- flag to show abstract syntax tree
[x] Add flag to toggle between static or dynamic scoping.
    It'd be nice if this was a command line argument
    Like: "java Parser -d" or "java Parser --dynamic" for dynamic scoping.
[x] It'd also be nice if we had flags for toggling between different kinds
    of output. Like...maybe a TRACE flag to show each step of execution,
    and maybe a DEBUG flag for more verbose output.
[ ] It'd be nice if we wrote debug output to a log file, since it's
    hard to view just printing to stdout.
